# TODO

- Ensure `/cephfs/shared/experiment_g/assets/models/Olmo-3-7B-Instruct` exists on the training host.
- Ensure `/cephfs/shared/experiment_g/assets/models/Olmo-3-7B-Instruct_torch_dist` is converted before launch.
- Fill `.env` judge/adversary endpoints and API keys on the target training host, plus verify MIU/EIL dataset paths in the project tree.
- Keep the EIL:MIU ratio at `2:1` and the total rollout budget at `200` unless a later experiment explicitly changes the checkpoint grid.
- A fresh machine should use `/root/experiment_g_runtime/conda/env` plus `/root/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`; no Docker path is required.
